||THINGS THAT NEED TO BE DONE||
===============================

Testing
=======

  + Compare isochrone boundary times are correctly calculated from 
    the directions routes. Can do this by getting location and time of boundary 
    point by hovering, and manually doing directions in 
    Google Maps from origin, then comparing the durations/distances etc.
  + Test ranges of time limits (large and small); see what breaks. 

Web Application
===============

  * Really need to start integrating the algorithm dev with the front end - 
    I can see this becoming messy if we leave it to the last minute. Need to 
    start working with the parameter input menus etc.

  + Need to keep track of isochrone origins - maybe a dynamic list? ability to
    delete them? Would be good to select which marker we want to calculate 
    isochrone for.
      - then have also ability to delete its isochrone (button which removes set
        of boundary points)
  + Check boxes for driving/walking/train (currently only driving implemented)
  + Reset button to start fresh (backend will remove all points etc.)
